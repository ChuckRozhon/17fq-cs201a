Canvas
~~~~~~

We will be using Canvas_ for much of the course administration.
This document, as well as all other downloads, are available on the Canvas site.
You will use Canvas for turning in your homeworks and paper reviews.

.. _Canvas: https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/146759

Gradescope
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Gradescope_ for quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a PDF version of your test immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account after we grade the first quiz.

.. _Gradescope: https://gradescope.com/courses/11391


Piazza
~~~~~~

We will use Piazza_ for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If you haven't used Piazza before, it's a cool tool that is essentially a message board for the class.
Both Justin and I will be on Piazza to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on piazza, that way all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing Justin or me.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!

Exam Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exam schedule is available on Canvas_.
Per official UC Davis policy (`http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/academicinfo/exams.html <http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/academicinfo/exams.html>`_),
if you have a a letter from the student disability center or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the 4th class (Oct 5th)**.

Other Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lectures and discussion will be recorded.
The videos for each class will be available on Canvas soon after the lecture.

Prerequisites
-------------

Undergraduate computer architecture course (e.g., ECS 154B).

I am going to assume you have knowledge of ISAs, simple pipelining, simple caching, and high-level computer organization.
These basics are covered in D. A. Patterson and J. L. Hennessy, `Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface`_.

Some of these topics are covered in the appendices of out Hennessy and Patterson book.
For instance, appendix A gives a great overview of ISA design and implications.
If you find you do not have enough background on a topic, start by checking the appendices of the book.

Class Format
------------

Lectures (Tuesday, Thursday 1:40 - 3:00 PM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our lecture time will be a traditional lecture structure.
You are expected to have read the sections from the book *before* attending lecture.
Lectures will not directly cover what is in the book.
Instead, lectures will build on what you have read in the book and dive deeper into topics.

Discussion (Monday 3:10 - 4:00 PM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discussions will be used for three things:

#. Discussing reading material.
#. Discussing the homeworks.
#. Short quizzes.

Each discussion class will be split between discussing the weekly paper and either a short quiz (~25 minutes) or a homework discussion.

Assignments and Tests
---------------------

Homeworks
~~~~~~~~~

There will be five homeworks throughout the quarter, with one due about every other week.
Homeworks will involve a programming assignment and answering a set of questions.
Homeworks will be graded based on the *answers to the assigned questions* in the form of a short report.

Turning in the homework consists of three parts:

#. Turning in your code before discussion begins on the due date.
#. Turning in a PDF of your report before discussion begins on the due date.
#. Bringing a *paper* copy of your report to class.

To turn in your code and your PDF report, we will use Canvas.

*Late homeworks receive an automatic 25% reduction per day they are late.
Homeworks will not be accepted for late submission four days after the due date.*

.. _below:

Quizzes
~~~~~~~

There will be four quizzes.
One will be given about every other week.
These quizzes are meant for both me and you to gauge your current understanding of the course.
There will be a mix of questions from the book, and new questions.

The quizzes will be open book, open paper, and open notes.
However, I can't allow electronic versions of books, papers, or notes.
This would be too easy for you to just Ctrl-F the answer!

(Note: I hate killing trees.
If you have a solution that keeps the spirit of open book quizzes, while allowing electronic versions, I am open to amending this policy.)

Paper Reading and Reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each week we will be reading a scientific paper from computer architecture literature.
This will give you an idea of either the history of architecture techniques discussed in lecture, or a perspective on current research.

Students are expected to have completed the assigned readings before attending class, and actively participate in discussions.
*For each paper, you will be required to turn in a short review by 6:00 AM Monday morning.*

To facilitate great class discussions, students must submit a review of selected papers by 6:00 AM before the discussion for which the paper is assigned.
*Late reviews will not be accepted.*

I encourage students to form study groups to discuss the papers before writing their reviews, but each student must write their own independent review.

Reviews will be submitted through Canvas via a text-only submission.
The review should be 20 to 40 lines (maximum 3200 characters) with:

 - a short summary of the problem the paper attacks and methods used, if any.
 - a short summary of the paper's results or key implications.
 - your opinion about what's good and bad about the paper.
 - a topic/question for lecture.

The last three points are key and best enable your review to stand out.

Reviews will be graded on a scale of Excellent (10 points), Satisfactory (7 points), and Unsatisfactory (3 points).
Most reviews will get a 7.
Reviews that are too long will automatically receive an Unsatisfactory grade.
The purpose here is to get students to read (and discuss) papers before they are discussed in class.

Grading
-------

Half of your final grade will come from homework/projects and quizzes.
The other half will come from the midterm and final.

The midterm will be given in class on 31 October 2017.

The final is scheduled for Tuesday, 12 December 2017, from 1:00 - 3:00 PM.
The location is the same as the lecture room.

Reading List
------------

Book
~~~~~~

In this class we'll be closely following `Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach`_ by J. L. Hennessy and D. A. Patterson.
You can find the book at the `university bookstore`_ or online.
This is a great book.
It's easy to read and very thorough.
Every computer architect should have a copy!

There is both a physical and a digital copy available.
You will be doing *a lot* of reading from the book, so I suggest you choose what is most comfortable to you.
We will also have open book quizzes (see below_), and you will *not* be able to use the electronic copy during the quizzes.

A PDF version of the book is available through ACM__.
You can get it free on a UC Davis network or through the `library VPN`_.

Reading List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be reading about one paper per week from the current computer architecture literature.
Each discussion you will be assigned one paper to review, although there may be other optional papers for you to read or skim.
The optional papers are not *required* to review, but they will be discussed in class and will further contribute to your understanding.

Below are links to the paper that will work if you are on campus or logged in with the `library VPN`_.
You can find pdfs of these paper on the Canvas_ site.
