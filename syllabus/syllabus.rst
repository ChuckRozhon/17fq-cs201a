Canvas
~~~~~~
We will be using canvas for much of the course administration.
This document, as well as all other downloads, are available on the canvas site.
You will use canvas for turning in your homeworks as well.

Canvas URL: https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/146759

Piazza
~~~~~~
We will use piazza for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If you haven't used piazza before, it's a cool tool that is essentially a message board for the class.
Both I and Justin will be on piazza to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on piazza, that way all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing me or Justin.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!

Other information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lectures and discussion will be recorded.
The videos for each class will be available on the canvas site soon after lecture.


Pre-requisites
--------------
Undergraduate computer architecture course (e.g., ECS 154B).

I am going to assume you have knowledge of ISAs, simple pipelining, simple caching, and high-level computer organization.
These basics are covered in D. A. Patterson and J. L. Hennessy, Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface.

Some of these topics are covered in the appendices of Hennessy and Patterson.
For instance, appendix A gives a great overview of ISA design and implications.
If you find you do not have enough background on a topic, start by checking the appendices of the book.


Book and reading materials
--------------------------
In this class we'll be closely following Hennessy and Patterson's Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach.
You can find the book at the University bookstore on online.
This is a great book.
It's easy to read and very thorough.
Every computer architect should have a copy!

There is both a physical and a digital copy available.
You will be doing *a lot* of reading from the book, so I suggest you choose what is most comfortable to you.
We will also have open book quizzes (see below), and you will *not* be able to use the electronic copy during the quizzes.


Class format
------------

Lectures (Tuesday & Thursday 1:40-3pm)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our lecture time will be a traditional lecture structure.
You are expected to have read the sections from the book *before* attending lecture.
Lecture will not directly cover what is in the book.
Instead, lecture will build on what you have read in the book and dive deeper into the topic.

Discussion (Monday 3:10-4pm)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discussions will be used for two things: 1) Discussing reading material and homeworks and 2) short quizzes.
Each discussion class will be split between discussing the weekly paper and either a short quiz (~25 minutes) or a homework discussion.

Homeworks
~~~~~~~~~

There will be five homeworks throughout the quarter, with one due about every-other week.
Homeworks will involve a programming assignment and answering a set of questions.
Homeworks will be graded based on the *answers to the assigned questions* in the form of a short report.

Turning in the homework consists of 3 parts:
1. Turning in your code before discussion begins on the due date.
2. Turning in a pdf of your report before discussion begins on the due date.
3. Bringing a *paper* copy of your report to class.

*Late assignments receive an automatic 25% reduction per day they are late.*

To turn in your code and the pdf of your report, we will use the online handin with canvas.

Quizzes
~~~~~~~

There will be four quizzes.
One will be given about every-other week.
These quizzes are meant for both me and you to gauge your current understanding the course.
There will be a mix of questions from the book and new questions.

The quizzes will be open book, open paper, and open notes.
However, I can't allow electronic versions of books, papers, or notes.
This would be too easy for you to just ctrl-f the answer!

(Note: I hate killing trees.
If you have a solution that keeps the spirit of open book quizzes and allows electronic version, I am open to amending this policy.)

Paper reading and reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each week we will be reading a scientific paper from the computer architecture literature.
This will give you an idea of either the history of architecture techniques discussed in lecture or a perspective on current research.

Students are expected to have completed the assigned readings before attending class and actively participate in discussions.
*For each paper, you will be required to turn in a short review by 6am Monday morning.*

To facilitate great class discussions, students must submit an email review of selected papers by 6:00am before the discussion for which the paper is assigned.
Late reviews will not be accepted and the time is based on when the email is received, not sent.

I encourage students are encouraged to form study groups to discuss the papers before writing their reviews, but each student must write their own independent review.

Reviews should be emailed to Prof. Jason Lowe-Power (jlowepower@ucdavis.edu) with:

::

    Subject: [ECS201A Review] Author1 Year
    (e.g., [ECS201A Review] Moore 1998)


The ASCII body of the message (NOT an attachment; NOT HTML; NOT PDF) should be 20 to 40 lines (maximum 3200 characters) with:
 - a short summary of the problem the paper attacks and methods used (if any),
 - a short summary of the paper's results or key implications,
 - your opinion about what's good and bad about the paper, and
 - a topic/question for lecture

Follow instructions exactly so that email filters do not lose your review.
The last three points are key and best enable your review to stand out.

Reviews will be graded on a scale of Excellent (10 points), Satisfactory (7 points), and Unsatisfactory (3 points).
Most reviews will get a 7.
Reviews that are too long will automatically receive an Unsatisfactory grade.
Reviews that fail to exactly follow the subject line rules will not be graded!
The purpose here is to get students to read (and discuss) papers before they
are discussed in class.


Grading
-------

Half of your final grade will come from homework/projects and quizzes and the other half from the midterm and final.

The midterm will be given in class on October 31st.
The final is scheduled for Tuesday December 12th from 1-3pm.

A detailed grading breakdown is below.

========= ========
Quizzes     20%

Homework    30%

Midterm     25%

Final       35%
